# Kanban Board 

## Description

This project involves enhancing an existing Kanban board application by integrating authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The goal is to create a secure login system that enables users to access and manage their tasks while ensuring their session is protected. This includes creating a functional login UI, updating the backend API for JWT authentication, and deploying the application to Render for live access.

### Key Features:
- Secure login with JWT-based authentication.
- Redirects for unauthorized users attempting to access protected pages.
- Deployment to Render for seamless access to the application.

## Installation

1. Load the application in your browser.

   - Valid credentials will log you in and redirect to the Kanban board.
